We have come up with this project SAHARA, which will act like a bridge to fill these information gaps and other problems. We believe that every individual has the power to bring happiness. So when you have the power to do such great things then why cannot we do something to bring smiles in face of needy people….. We believe that every donation matters whether it is small or big but the willingness to donate and help someone also plays a big role in helping the needy people.

Major goals of this project are:

• To provide Social, Educational and Economic Empowerment to Women and Children.

• To help to act as a bridge between non-profit organisation and the needy people so that their needs are fulfilled.

• To identify the homeless and the destitute and facilitate their relocation in appropriate institutions.
